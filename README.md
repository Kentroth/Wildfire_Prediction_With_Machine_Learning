# Wildfire_Prediction_With_Machine_Learning
A machine-learning project focused on predicting wild-fire risk based on historic meteorological data.

Data Sources:

NOAA Weather Data: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/by_year/ for annual data and here for documentation https://docs.opendata.aws/noaa-ghcn-pds/readme.html

Wildfire Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/behroozsohrabi/us-wildfire-records-6th-edition/code


## Combining wildfire data with weather readings across the United States. Used to train models to determine factors that cause fire outbreaks.
* Identified wildfire and weather data sources, matching the two datasets based on date and location
* Using Random Forest and ML Neural network train, test and deploy the model to predict the probability of wild fire
* Display a wildfire map across US showing change over a 10 year peiod
